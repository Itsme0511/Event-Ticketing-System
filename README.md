A blockchain-powered platform to manage the event ticketing system, where data  are stored on-chain as encrypted data. Consumers have full control over the transparency of the tickets as well as the betting system for  bidding the tickets as well as the royalties to the event organizer. Tickets are created in the form of NFTs for the Blockchain system and transparency.

Key Features of the APP
Fraud Prevention:
NFT-based tickets are tamper-proof and verifiable on-chain, eliminating duplication or forgery.

Fair Pricing:
Smart contracts enforce maximum resale prices and royalties to prevent scalping while ensuring fair compensation for organizers.

Transparency:
All transactions (minting, resale, bidding) are recorded on the blockchain and are publicly verifiable.

Decentralization:
The system removes reliance on centralized platforms by enabling direct interactions between users via smart contracts.

User-Friendly Design:
Integrates familiar tools like wallets (MetaMask) with off-chain storage (Supabase) to provide a seamless experience even for non-crypto-savvy users.
